# PersonalAiTrainerApp
The Personal AI Trainer App is a unique and interactive application that assists users in monitoring their arm exercises using real-time video feedback. Using the power of computer vision, this app tracks the user's arm movements and counts the number of repetitions performed.

Key features include:
Real-time Pose Detection: Harnessing the PoseModule, the application can detect specific landmarks on the user's body, allowing it to accurately track arm movements.

Repetition Counting: The application provides real-time counting for both the right and left arms, ensuring users maintain a balanced workout.

Interactive UI: The application offers a modern user interface complete with live video feedback, progress bars indicating the angle of the arm movement, and labels showcasing the total repetitions.

Gradient Feedback: The progress bars dynamically change color based on the angle of the arm, transitioning between cold (red) and hot (green) colors. This offers an engaging visual cue to users regarding their current exercise posture.

Ease of Use: Intuitive control buttons allow users to start, stop, or exit the application with ease.

Safe Exit: On closing the application, the video resource is properly released, ensuring no lingering processes.
